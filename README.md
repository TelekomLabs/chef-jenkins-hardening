# Jenkins Hardening

This project is DEPRECATED and NO LONGER SUPPORTED. If you think this should really be supported, [reach out](https://dev-sec.io/community/) and we can discuss options.

This cookbook aims to provide a default jenkins setup that is secure. Specifically it

- installs jenkins behind nginx
- configures ssl for nginx
- configures user logins
- runs jenkins slaves on different servers

Currently this cookbook is work-in-progress and is not yet considered secure enough for production use.

# Usage

This cookbook is optimized for a usage with [chef-os-hardening](https://github.com/TelekomLabs/chef-os-hardening) and [chef-ssh-hardening](https://github.com/TelekomLabs/chef-ssh-hardening), but has no direct dependency. Therefore this cookbook is even happy without them.

# Test

```bash
# Install dependencies
gem install bundler
bundle install

# Do lint checks
bundle exec rake lint

# Kitchen test
bundle exec kitchen list
bundle exec kitchen test default-ubuntu-1204

```
